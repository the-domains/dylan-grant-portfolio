Holland America Line user experience web app for cruise guests. Allows guest to see what's going happening on the ship, book excursions and dining reservations, view and update their itinerary, see their spending, and access information about the ship including the ship's official time. 

Designed both mobile and offline first - access to internet is unreliable and expensive and user may not always be on the ship (and on it's intranet), so we had to design this app to work almost completely (no transactions) offline.

Tech personally used in project: Angular (javascript, html, less), Grunt, Nginx.
